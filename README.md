# Biomarker-Assays

[Biomarkers Assays](https://pointcrosslifesciences.com/biomarker-assays/)Â are becoming more crucial for clinical research and biologics testing. These tests can be employed as a surrogate / pharmacodynamics (PD) marker for monitoring clinical efficacy, helping to identify a lead candidate and understanding the mechanism of action of a medicine. In order to shorten follow-up times, [biomarker assays](https://pointcrosslifesciences.com/biomarker-assays/) are also helpful for detecting intermediate success endpoints.
Strong and relevant results across complicated sample matrices and anticoagulants must be gathered from validated or fit-for-purpose quantitative biomarker assays to back your submission's efficacy claims.
